## Overview

This project is a versatile [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate designed to expedite the development of cross-platform mobile applications. It offers a well-structured architecture that optimizes the separation of concerns between the UI and business logic. The codebase is meticulously documented, making it easy for developers to understand and integrate into their projects.

**If you find this boilerplate useful, please consider giving the repository a star.**

## Architecture

The core principle of the boilerplate is the clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentational components** are distinct from **screens**.
- Global [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) stores manage **state**.
- Application side-effects (such as API calls) are isolated from UI and state manipulation using [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/).

## Features

The boilerplate includes:

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) (v**0.72.7**)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (v4.2.1) for state management
- [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) (v6.0.0) for state persistence
- [Redux Sagas](https://redux-saga.js.org) (v1.2.3) for managing side-effects and logic
- [React Navigation 6](https://reactnavigation.org/) with a [`NavigationService`](App/Navigation/NavigationService.js) for routing and navigation
- [i18Next](https://www.i18next.com/) (v23.7.6) for multilingual support
- [Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/) (v18.6.1) integration
- Integrated push notifications
- [Code-Push](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push) (v8.1.0) for dynamic updates
- [react-native-fbsdk-next](https://github.com/thebergamo/react-native-fbsdk-next) (v12.1.1) for Facebook login
- [google-signin](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin) (v10.1.1) for Google Sign-In
- [Theme Support](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html) with a [`DarkTheme`](App/Theme/DarkTheme.js) and [`LightTheme`](App/Theme/LightTheme.js)
- [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) (v3.3.0) configured by default
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (v0.19.2) for API calls
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) configured for React Native
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) pre-configured for React Native

## Directory Layout

The project follows a clear directory structure:

- [`app/components`](app/components): Presentational components
- [`app/containers`](app/containers): Application screens
- [`app/assets`](app/assets): Assets (images, audio files)
- [`app/i18next`](app/localization): Language setup and localization
- [`app/navigation`](app/navigation): React-Navigation settings
- [`app/redux/store`](app/redux/store): Redux stores (separated by module)
- [`app/redux/sagas`](app/redux/sagas): Redux sagas for each module
- [`app/configs`](app/configs): Configuration for staging and production servers
- [`app/services`](app/services): Services for API calls and SDK functions
- [`app/constants`](app/constants): Screen routes, endpoints, and design helpers
- [`app/theme`](app/theme): Light and Dark theme configurations
- [`app/utils`](app/utils): Common helper functions for design and styles

## Requirements

Node 8 or greater is required. For iOS development, a Mac and Xcode 9 or newer are necessary. Dependencies required by React Native can be found in the [Android development guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-3) and [iOS development guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies).

## Getting Started

To use this boilerplate for a new project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Remove the previous git history: `rm -rf .git/`
3. Install npm dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`.
4. Rename the React Native project:
   - Without custom Bundle Identifier:
     - `yarn run rename -- <YourProjectName>` or `npm run rename -- <YourProjectName>` (default name is `boilerplate`).
   - With custom Bundle Identifier (Android only, for iOS use Xcode):
     - `yarn run rename -- <YourProjectName> -b <bundleIdentifier>` or `npm run rename -- <YourProjectName> -b <bundleIdentifier>` (default name is `boilerplate`).
5. [Facebook SDK Android/iOS Setup](https://github.com/thebergamo/react-native-fbsdk-next): Replace `FacebookAppID`, `FacebookClientToken`, and `FacebookLoginProtocolScheme` values in the `.env.staging` and `.env.production` files.
6. [Google Sign-In SDK

Android Setup](https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/): Place your `google-services.json` into the `Android/app` folder. 7. [Google Sign-In SDK iOS Setup](https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/): For iOS, drag your `GoogleService-Info.plist` to the Xcode project folder and replace `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` in `.env.staging` and `.env.production`. 8. [Optional] [Codepush Android Setup](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/setup-android.md): Insert your App Center app_secret into `android/app/src/main/assets/appcenter-config.json`. In the App Center, generate production and staging deployment keys and place them in `.env.production` and `.env.staging` against `CodePushDeploymentKey_Android`. 9. [Optional] [Codepush iOS Setup](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/setup-ios.md): Insert your App Center app_secret into `AppCenter-Config.plist`. In the App Center, generate production and staging deployment keys and place them in `.env.production` and `.env.staging` against `CodePushDeploymentKey_iOS`. 10. Create a new git repository for your project (`git init`) and commit.

## Running the Project

Once all the requirements are installed, set up and run the project:

1. Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`.
2. For Android:
   - Generate a debug key only the first time:
     - `cd android/app`
     - `keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`
     - `cd ../..`
   - Start the metro bundler: `yarn start` or `npm install`.
   - Run the Android application: `yarn run android:staging:release` or `npm run android:staging:release`.
3. For iOS:
   - `cd ios`
   - `pod install`
   - `cd ..`
   - Run the iOS application: `react-native run-ios`.
